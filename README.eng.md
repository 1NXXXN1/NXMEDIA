With this script, [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), [Kinopoisk](https://www.kinopoisk.ru/) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) will become free online cinemas! On each page with a movie or TV series, a flag will appear in the upper left corner. By clicking on it, you will open a player with the movie.

## Installation ðŸŽ“

1. Install one of the extensions for running custom scripts:

    - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) _(recommended)_
    - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
    - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
    - [Userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts)

2. Enable [developer mode in your browser](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=ru#Q209).

3. Install the script by going to [this link](https://github.com/1NXXXN1/NXMEDIA/raw/refs/heads/main/userscript/operator.user.js). _(or download `operator.user.js` from folder `userscript`) and install manually)_

Done, now open a page with a movie _([example](https://letterboxd.com/film/babylon-2022/))_ and click on the flag in the upper left corner!

> If the flag doesn't appear, check if the script is installed correctly and restart your browser.

3. Install the edited script.

> Self-hosting doesn't guarantee 100% site functionality, as [Kinobox API](https://kinobox.tv/) is used to obtain sources, which is currently impossible to deploy independently.
