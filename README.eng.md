With this script, [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), [Kinopoisk](https://www.kinopoisk.ru/), and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) will become free online cinemas! On every movie or TV show page, a banner will appear in the top left corner. Clicking on it will open a player with the movie.

## Installation ðŸŽ“

1. Install one of the browser extensions to run custom scripts:

    - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) _(recommended)_
    - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
    - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
    - [Userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts)

2. Enable [developer mode in your browser](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q209).
3. Install the script by following [this link](https://github.com/Kirlovon/Tape-Operator/raw/master/tape-operator.user.js). _(or download `tape-operator.user.js` and install manually)_

Done! Now open a movie page _([example](https://letterboxd.com/film/babylon-2022/))_ and click on the flag in the top left corner!

> If the flag does not appear, check if the script is installed correctly and restart your browser.

<br>

## Deploy ðŸš€

In case the link to the player is blocked in your country, you can deploy your own version of the site!

> This instruction is intended for developers and other users with necessary technical skills.

1. Publish a static website located in the `player` folder of this repository.

    - Files and the `index.html` page should be accessible at the main address. _(http://example.com/index.html or simply http://example.com)_

    - Remove the analytics script found in the header of the `index.html` file to avoid sending anonymous analytics.

2. Edit the script from the `userscript` folder:

    - Replace the `PLAYER_URL` variable with a link to your site.

    - Add a line with a link to your site in the `@match` header. This is necessary for the browser to execute the script on your player page.

    - Remove the `@updateURL` and `@downloadURL` headers from the file so the script does not attempt to update itself.

    - Ensure that the version in the `@version` header matches or is not lower than the version specified in the `player.js` file under the `REQUIRED_VERSION` variable. Otherwise, the site will display a script outdated notification.

3. Install the edited script.

> Self-hosting does not guarantee 100% site functionality as it is based on the [Kinobox](https://kinobox.tv/) player, which currently cannot be self-deployed.
